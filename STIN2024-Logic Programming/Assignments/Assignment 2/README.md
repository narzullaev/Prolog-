# Assignment 2
## Description

This assignmebt was given from **STIN2024 -Logic Programmins** as Assignemnet 2 from the series of Assignments. We were asked to improve
the *Assignment 1*. In previous Assignment  we simply built translator to translate words from the existing words we have added 
as facts. In Assignmnet 2 we were asked to add rules to ask from the user to add new words with meaning. In this case if the word which 
the user enters is not existed in the database then the system will ask to enter the meaning. There are major changes in Assignment 2 
comparing to Assignment 1.
